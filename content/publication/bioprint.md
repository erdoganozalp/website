abstract = "Proteins are the most common molecules found in cells and are vital to all life. To date, scientists identified over thousand proteins that are secreted by human cells. This secretome is necessary for our tissues, organs, and body to function properly. As a starting point of creating artificial organs, in this work, we have developed a functional inkjet printing system, designed to print protein solutions to any solid surface."
