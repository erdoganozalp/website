The inkjet printers have two axes of movement, one for scrolling of the paper and the other for traveling of the cartridges. To use this accurate and low cost controller card in 3 dimensional systems, a new method was introduced. The third dimension of the part is represented with gray color scale. With a two-dimensional and gray colored drawing of the part, the system is able to produce a workpiece with a single print command.
