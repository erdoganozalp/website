In 2012, as a part of Robert Bosch Foundation Fellow program, I interned at Bosch Injection Systems site for 4 months. My project was to reduce the support ring assembly loses which was controlled by machine vision system. As a first step, we have done a fishbone analysis and identified the possible failures. After a few days of observation, we have collected the data and analyzed to identify the abnormal conditions. To solve the problem, parameters, control points and approaches were updated. The loses were reduced close to zero.
