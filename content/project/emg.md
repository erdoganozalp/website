Electromyography is the recording of electrical muscle activity, which is activated by motor neurons and the resulting electrical signals produced by the muscle fibers. Produced signals are collected by electrodes placed on the specific muscle. EMG signals are used and integrated within small or even tiny intelligent, automatic, robotic, and mechatronics systems. In this project, we have developed a signal amplification and filtering circuit using an instrumentation amplifier with differential amplification technology and low-pass & high-pass passive filters.
