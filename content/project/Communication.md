The aim of the project was to design a compact and low-priced video communication system. To minimize the cost, and make it more accessible, the system was designed to support regular webcams. In 3 months, a communication panel was built, which has an IP-Video streamer without a need of an embedded operating system.

The publication (In Turkish) presented in TOK 2013 can be found [here](../../pdf/Communication_Panel.pdf).
