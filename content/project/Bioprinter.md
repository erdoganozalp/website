The developments on tissue engineering in last 15 years allowed researchers to engineer basic tissues. But using cell seeding method to produce these basic tissues, needs long time to produce and is not effective enough.
The drop-on-demand cell printing method is accepted as pioneering work in biofabrication techniques. This method allows to position the cells, biomaterials and other required drugs and materials in 2 and 3 dimensional plane as required. In 2003, to make the progress faster and more effective, researchers started to modify the desktop printers for robust deposition of living cells. The method was successfully developed and optimized for better printing until today.
The aim of this project is to develop the printing module of a bioprinter. A circuit board which is able to control the cartridges with produced output signals was designed. Then, a software was developed to create layers from the input image and control the cartridges using Arduino board. The prototype system successfully printed bovine serum albumin homogeneously.

The outcome of this project was presented in ICETAS 2016. It can be found [here](../../pdf/Bioprinter.pdf).
